- First tetra.py must by run as sudo to avoid: "TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer" on line 242. This only applies to generating the hash table

- Investigating deprication warning on lign ~490(and others). I get:

tetra.py:489: VisibleDeprecationWarning: using a non-integer number instead of an integer will result in an error in the future
  star_centroids.sort(key=lambda yx:-np.sum(normalized_image[yx[0]-window_radius:yx[0]+window_radius+1, yx[1]-window_radius:yx[1]+window_radius+1]))

After testing, it looks like:

yx[0]-window_radius:yx[0]+window_radius+1, yx[1]-window_radius:yx[1]+window_radius+1

is evalutating as a float, and should instead be an integer.

FIXED by adding: int() conversion to each part of the calculation:

star_centroids.sort(key=lambda yx:-np.sum(normalized_image[int(yx[0]-window_radius):int(yx[0]+window_radius+1), int(yx[1]-window_radius):int(yx[1]+window_radius+1)]))

- deprication warning on lin 663:

tetra.py:663: FutureWarning: elementwise comparison failed; returning scalar instead, but in the future will perform elementwise comparison
  if image_vector == "multiple matches":

FIXED: change comparison to:

if (type(image_vector) is str):
