Tetra Optimization Flow

ST = Star Tracker
OS = Oresat

Prediction Mode: OS has not used ST in a while but thinks it knows where it is looking
- ADACS System continuously sends predicted RA/DEC to ST
    > ST finds the narrowest Star Catalogue encompassing those coordinates and loads that catalogue into RAM
- ADACS System tell

    
    
    
    
    
Continuous Mode: OS has been STing and has a very good idea where it is looking

Lost in Space Mode: OS has no idea where it is looking. This is default if all other modes fail to find a match

Notes:
  - The overlap between the cached catalogs should be > half the field of view
